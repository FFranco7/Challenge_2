In this project we will be qualifying loans, saving in CSV files and interacting with the user through questions for the enhancement of an efficient Loan Qualifier Application. The usage of multiple functions and data will be driven through a modular development approach.

## Technologies

The development will be done using Python through VS code, git and github will serve to create the repos and develop the libraries to store files along with the uploading and downloading process. Efficiency will be key, now that the usage of functions for: data import, qualifiers & filtering, calculations and equations, are designed applying a modular approach. This provides a DRY implementation, lower re-processes and resources (code) optimization.
