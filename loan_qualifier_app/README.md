# Loan Qualifier App

In this project we will be qualifying loans, saving in CSV files and interacting with the user through questions for the enhancement of an efficient Loan Qualifier Application. The usage of multiple functions and data will be driven through a modular development approach.

## Technologies

The development will be done using Python through VS code, git and github will serve to create the repos and develop the libraries to store files along with the uploading and downloading process. Efficiency will be key, now that the usage of functions for: data import, qualifiers & filtering, calculations and equations, are designed applying a modular approach. This provides a DRY implementation, lower re-processes and resources (code) optimization.

## Description

This App will be useful to analyze loan viability by implementing qualifications standandards through an automated process. For example, someone who is interested in knowing whether he or she is qualified for a loan can easily input data by answering a few questions from the app and receive a response within seconds! Also, besides being useful as a "live" product with the capacity to provide immediate response to users, it can also analyze entire databases or files by extracting the required parameters and anlyzing massive amounts of information to draw intelligent decisions to determine who qualifies and who does not qualify for the loan.

## Usage

Let's say Peter wants to get a loan because he wants to buy a house. Peter would need to provide personal information such as his credit score, amount of debt, income, desired loan amount and home value. Once he provides this information, the App will calculate his debt to income ratio along with the loan to value ratio. Furthermore, utilizing the following 4 qualification filters: max loan amount, credit score, income to debt ratio and loan to debt ratio, the App will notify whether Peter qualifies for the loan or not. It does not stop there! the App can also store information regarding loan qualification status and attributes from every applicant.
